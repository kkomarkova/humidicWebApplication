# What is Humidic Web app ?
Breathing in humid air activates the nerves in the lungs, that narrow and tighten the
airways. Humidity also makes the air stagnant enough to trap pollutants and allergens like
pollen, dust, mold, dust mites, and smoke. These can set off the asthma symptoms such as
coughing, wheezing and many more.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), it is best to keep humidity levels between 30–50%. 
Though you cannot change the weather outside, we want to help the asthma patients keep
the humidity at their home or room set to a comfortable 30 to 50 percent. 
To be able to achieve that, we are developing a web application to help the asthma
patients. 
The idea of the web application is to have a device that is installed in the asthma patient's
room, that checks the humidity level in the room. The patient can set an alert if they want,
so they will be notified when the humidity level is higher or lower that values they have
defined. The webpage will also display the temperature and humidity outside.
